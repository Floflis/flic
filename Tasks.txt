- differentiate build and attempt (so no need anymore for FLIC.sh for now)
- FLIC-local.sh: now only $buildlog_dir, but also $attemptlog_dir

implement these 3 at same time:
- don't anymore get the year from $current_distro/config, but from https://bard.google.com/u/4/chat/bc605e2e07b64d64
- doing an new attempt will generate a build number as well!
- auto change DNA's $current_distro/config's $osbuild, $year, $specialbuildattempt
- run $current_distro/layers/soil/include/img/watermarkmaker/run.sh

- /hooks: post-init-build (in my personal case, will read from $diruse - ensure export to hooks - and create an new $diruse.txt in attemptsTasks), post-finish-build
